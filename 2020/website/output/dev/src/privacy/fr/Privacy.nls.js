If you use this website, various pieces of personal data will be collected.
Personal information is any data with which you could be personally identified.
This privacy policy explains what information we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this happens.<br>
Please note that data transmitted via the internet (e.g. via email communication) may be subject to security breaches.

*SSL or TLS encryption*<br>
This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and for the protection of the transmission of confidential content,
