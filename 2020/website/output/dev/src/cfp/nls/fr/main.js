A conference about the present and future of ActivityPub,
the world’s leading federated social web standard.
<br><br>
Following a successful inaugural conference in [2019](https://redaktor.me/apconf/),
we have expanded APConf 2020 to a four day event that will occur entirely on line
via Big Blue Button.
<br>
This year’s conference will include pre- recorded talks with live question and
answer sessions, birds of a feather sessions, lightning round talks, and a hackathon
that follows the conference.`,
    cfp: `
We *invite* proposals for birds of a feather session topics and 30- 60 minute talks
related to ActivityPub. Topics may include, but are not limited to:`,
    cfpList: `
- projects and implementations
- community management and hosting
- and ActivityPub extensions.`,
    registration: `
To *submit* a talk or BoF, please include your title and a brief summary with your registration.
<br><br>
Due to bandwidth limitations of video conferencing software, we ask for those
who wish to participate in the Big Blue Button sessions to register.
<br>
Registration will be on a first-come first-serve basis.
<br>
There is *no registration fee*.
<br>
All of the recorded talks will be uploaded to ConfTube and freely available regardless of registration
a week prior to the conference.`,
